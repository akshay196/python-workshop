# Fun with Python 3

A hands on tutorial intented towards learning Python3 by solving problems.

## Problem Statement:
Python Programming langauage is Open Source. It's code and all development
happens on github.

Source code url of Python: https://github.com/python/cpython

Github also provides a nice feature to show the contributors of any project.

Let's write a program to show
* Top 10 contributors of cpython project with their names
* Numbers of commits made by the contributors
* Find list of contributors having same number of commits

## Let's Solve it
