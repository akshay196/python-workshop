# Fun with Python 3

A hands-on tutorial intended for learning Python3 by solving problems.

## Problem Statement:
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an open source programming language. In 1991, [Guido van 
Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) made Python. It's code is open source and 
all development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/python/cpython).

Source code URL of Python: https://github.com/python/cpython

Github also provides a nice feature to show the contributors to any project.

Let's write a program to show
* Top 10 contributors of CPython project with their names
* Numbers of commits made by the contributors
* Find list of contributors having the same number of commits

## Let's Solve it

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.
Check by typing python3 in terminal.
```
[chandankumar@ironman ~]$ python3
Python 3.7.2 (default, Mar 21 2019, 10:09:12) 
[GCC 8.3.1 20190223 (Red Hat 8.3.1-2)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
